Input,Log Elasticity DLW Production to GDP Per Capita,"Log elasticity :math:`\varepsilon` of domestic wastewater production per capita to GDP/capita. For a year over year growth in GDP/capita :math:`\Delta g`, the change in domestic wastewater production per capita is estimated as :math:`\Delta W_{d} = (1 + \Delta g)^{\varepsilon} - 1`.",,,,"Derived from Jones, E.
