Input,:math:`\text{K}_{REM}` Sludge Factor,Fraction of raw sludge removed from aerboic treatmeant plants ,``physparam_krem_sludge_factor_$CAT-WASTEWATER-TREATMENT$``,,``treated_aerobic``,"See V5, C6, Equation 6.3B and Table 6.6A in 2019R IPCC GNGHGI. Increasing this factor can represent investments in upgrades to aerobic treatment (or new facilities).",,,0,0.46,1.39
