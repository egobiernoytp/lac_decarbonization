Anaerobic Digester,``anaerobic_digester``, | Includes Digesters of high quality and low leakage and digesters with high leakage. Allows for the capture of biogas and/or flaring.,0,0
Anaerobic Lagoon,``anaerobic_lagoon``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""A type of liquid storage system designed and operated to combine waste stabilization and storage. Lagoons have a lower depth and a much larger surface compared to liquid slurry stores. Anaerobic lagoons are designed with varying lengths of storage (up to a year or greater), depending on the climate region, the volatile solids loading rate, and other operational factors. The supernatant water from the lagoon may be recycled as flush water or used to irrigate and fertilise fields.""

Burned for Fuel and Incineration,``incineration``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""The dung and urine are excreted on fields. The sun dried dung cakes are burned for fuel.""",1,0
Composting,``composting``," | Composting. Includes In-vessel, static pile, intensive widrow, and passive widrow.

 | **NOTE:** MCFs for static pile, intensive widrow, and passive widrow are dependent on climate zones.",0,0
Daily Spread,``daily_spread``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""Manure is routinely removed from a confinement facility and is applied to cropland or pasture within 24 hours of excretion.""
 | 
 | **NOTE:** MCFs are highly dependent on climate zones.",0,0
Deep Bedding,``deep_bedding``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""As manure accumulates, bedding is continually added to absorb moisture over a production cycle and possibly for as long as 6 to 12 months. This manure management system also is known as a bedded pack manure management system and may be combined with a dry lot or pasture. Manure may undergo periods where animals are present and are actively mixing the manure, or periods in which the pack is undisturbed.""
 | 
 | Default uses average of 1-12 Months. Transformations can include shortening deep bedding. See V4, C10, Table 10.17 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R for default values.

 | **NOTE:** MCFs are highly dependent on climate zones.",0,0
Dry Lot,``dry_lot``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""A paved or unpaved open confinement area without any significant vegetative cover. Dry lots do not require the addition of bedding to control moisture. Manure may be removed periodically and spread on fields.""

 | **NOTE:** MCFs are highly dependent on climate zones.",0,0
Liquid Slurry and Pit Storage,``liquid_slurry``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R of **Liquid Slurry**: ""Manure is stored as excreted or with some minimal addition of water or bedding material in tanks or ponds outside the animal housing. Manure is removed and spread on fields once or more in a calendar year. Manure is agitated before removal from the tank/ponds to ensure that most of the VS are removed from the tank.""
 | 
 | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R of **Pit Storage**: ""Collection and storage of manure usually with little or no added water typically below a slatted floor in an enclosed animal confinement facility, usually for periods less than one year. Manure may be pumped out of the storage to a secondary storage tank multiple times in one year, or stored and applied directly to fields. It is assumed that VS removal rates on tank emptying are >90%.""

"Pasture, Range, and Paddock",``paddock_pasture_range``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""The manure from pasture and range grazing animals is allowed to lie as deposited, and is not managed.""",0,1
Poultry Manure With and Without Litter,``poultry_manure``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R of **Poultry Manure with Litter**: ""Similar to cattle and swine deep bedding except usually not combined with a dry lot or pasture. Typically used for all poultry breeder flocks, for alternative systems for layers and for the production of meat type chickens (broilers) and other fowl. Litter and manure are left in place with added bedding during the poultry production cycle and cleaned between poultry cycles, typically 5 to 9 weeks in productive systems and greater in lower productivity systems.""
 | 
 | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R of **Poultry Manure without Litter**: May be similar to open pits in enclosed animal confinement facilities or may be designed and operated to dry the manure as it accumulates. The latter is known as a high-rise manure management system and is a form of passive windrow composting when designed and operated properly. Some intensive poultry farms installed the manure belt under the cage, where the manure is dried inside housing.",0,0
Solid Storage,``storage_solid``," | Definition from V4, C10, Table 10.18 IPCC GNGHGI 2019R: ""The storage of manure, typically for a period of several months, in unconfined piles or stacks. Manure is able to be stacked due to the presence of a sufficient amount of bedding material or loss of moisture by evaporation.
Solid stores can be covered or compacted. In some cases, bulking agent or additives are added .""
 | 
 | Transformations can improve methane correction factors for VS in this pathway by including covering/compacting or adding bulking agents or additives that reduce GHG generation.
