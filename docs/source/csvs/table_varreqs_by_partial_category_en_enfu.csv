Input, Import/Export Ratio Scalar," | Scalar to modify the ratio of imports to exports in future time steps. Should always be 1 at time :math:`t = 0` (**NOTE:** the model forces normalization to 1 at time :math:`t = 0`, so future trajectories entered for this variable are represented as relative change to the initial time step).
 | 
 | If == 1, then the ratio of imports to exports entered at time :math:`t = 0` is preserved. If < 1, then the ratio is reduced.
 | 
 | This variable should be non-negative--for example, if exports exceed imports at time :math:`t = 0`, then the Import/Export ratio is < 1. For example, suyppose the I/E ratio implied by initial imports and exports is 0.5--then entering a value of 3 in this variable will increase the I/E ratio to 1.5, meaning that imports exceed exports. The model  uses the scalar to project changes to domestic production in future time steps.",``scalar_enfu_ratio_imports_to_exports_$CAT-FUEL$``,,``fuel_coal``|``fuel_natural_gas``|``fuel_oil``,,,,0,1,1
