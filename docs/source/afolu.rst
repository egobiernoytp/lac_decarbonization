Agriculture
===========

The **Agriculture** subsector is used to quantify emissions associated with growing crops, including emissions from the release of soil carbon, fertilizer applications and crop liming, crop burning, methane emissions from paddy rice fields, **AND MORE;CONTINUE**. Agriculture is divided into the following categories (crops), given by the metavariable ``$CAT-AGRICULTURE$``. Each crop should be associated an FAO classifications. `See the FAO <https://www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/economic/faodef/annexe.htm>`_ for the source of these classifications and a complete mapping of crop types to categories. On the git, the table ``ingestion/FAOSTAT/ref/attribute_fao_crop.csv`` contains the information mapping each crop to this crop type. Note, this table can be used to merge and aggregate data from FAO into these categories. If a crop type is not present in a country, set the associated area as a fraction of crop area to 0.

Categories
----------

Forestry is divided into the following categories. These categories reflect an aggregation of forestry types into emission-relevant categories. Note that areas of forested land are determined in the **Land Use** subsector. The land use at time *t* is determined by an ergodic Markov Chain (probabilities are set in the variable input table and subject to uncertainty using the mixing approach)

Land Use
========

Land use projections are driven by a Markov Chain, represented by a transition matrix :math:`Q(t)` (the matrix is specified for each time period in the ``model_input_variables.csv`` file). The model requires initial states (entered as a fraction of total land area) for all land use categories ``$CAT-LANDUSE$``.

.. note::
   The entries :math:`Q_{ij}(t)` give the transition probability of land use category :math:`i` to land use category :math:`j`. :math:`Q` is row stochastic, so that :math:`\sum_{j}Q_{ij}(t) = 1` for each land use category :math:`i` and time period :math:`t`. To preserve row stochasticity, it is highly recommended that strategies and uncertainty be represented using the trajectory mixing approach, where bounding trajectories on transitions probabilities are specified and uncertainty exploration gives a mix between them.

Land Use Model and Assumptions
------------------------------

The **MODELNAMEHERE** does not calculate a general equilibrium for land use demand. Instead, land use is specified as a policy that is adjusted based on demand for livestock (which modifies the area of grassland available) and crops. A rule-based approach is to reallocate land at each time step in response to changing demands. This ruleset is described below.

.. note::
   Non-grazing livestock--including pigs and chickens--are assumed to be produced endogenously independently of land use.

#. **Estimate the livestock carrying capacity of land at each time step for grazing livestock**. First, a carrying capacity :math:`\chi_v(t)` of livestock/hectare is calculated for grazing livestock. The capacity at time *t* is estimated in a few steps.

   * The initial carrying capacity implied by the historical period :math:`\chi_v(0)` is estimated as :math:`\chi_v(0) = L_v(0)G_v(0)^{-1}`, where:

      * :math:`L_v(0)` is the initial population of livestock cateogry *v* at time 0, given by the **Initial Livestock Head Count** variable.

      * :math:`G_v(0)` is the area of grassland (or grazing land/pastures) allocated to each livestock of type *v* and is fixed over time. This is estimated using the **Daily Dry Matter Consumption** of each animal at time :math:`t = 0`, :math:`F_v(0)`; the population of livestock at :math:`t = 0`, :math:`L_v(0)` (and the vector :math:`L(0)`); and the initial area of grassland, :math:`x_g(0)`, where *g* is the index for grassland in the land use initial vector and :math:`x_g(0) = Ap_g(0)` , where :math:`p_j(0)` is the **Initial Land Use Area Proportion** of land use type *j* and *A* is specified as the **Area of Country**.

      * The estimated carrying capacity of the land :math:`G_v(0) = G(0)\frac{L_v(0)F_v(0)}{L(0)\cdot F(0)}`.

   * Note that the calculation of :math:`\chi_v(0)` simplifies to :math:`\chi_v(0) = \frac{L(0)\cdot F(0)}{G(0)F_v(0)}`.

   * The livestock carrying capacity at time *t* is then :math:`\chi_v(t) = c(t)\chi_v(0)`, where :math:`c(t)` is the **Carrying Capacity Scalar**, which is to represent changes to pasture management that enable increases in the number of livestock that can graze per acre--including activities like shared grazing.

#. **Estimate preliminary land use areas** Land use is estimated using a discrete-time ergodic Markov Chain.

   * Let :math:`x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m` be the vector of land use by type at time *t* (where there are *m* categories of land use).

   * Then let :math:`\tilde{Q}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}` be the exogenous (specified as a policy), unadjusted row-stochastic land use transition matrix from time :math:`t \to t + 1`, so that that :math:`\tilde{Q}_{ij}(t)` gives the transition probability of land use category :math:`i` to land use category :math:`j`.

   * Without adjustments, the area of each land use type at time *t* is :math:`\tilde{x}(t + 1) = x(t)^{T}\tilde{Q}_{ij}(t)`.

#. **Estimate livestock demand and unadjusted production** Livestock demand at time *t* :math:`D_v^{(lvst)}(t)` is represented as a function of population and GDP/capita, with the assumption that demand and supply are in equilibrium at :math:`t = 0` (i.e., :math:`D_v^{(lvst)}(0) = L_v(0)`).

   * Let :math:`M(t)` be the GDP/capita at time *t* (GDP and population are both exogenously defined, where the population is the sum of the rural and urban population), and let :math:`\Delta M(t) = \frac{M(t + 1)}{M(t)} - 1` be the growth rate of GDP/capita.

   * Let :math:`\lambda_v` be the demand elasticity for livestock category *v* to changes in GDP/capita (we use income elasticities as a proxy).

   * Let :math:`P(t)` be the total population at time *t*, and let the per-capita demand for livestock at :math:`t = 0` be :math:`\hat{D}_v^{(lvst)}(0) = P(0)/D_v^{(lvst)}(0)`.

   * The demand for livestock at time :math:`t > 0` is :math:`D_v^{(lvst)}(t) = P(t)\hat{D}_v^{(lvst)}(t)`, where the per-capita demand :math:`\hat{D}_v^{(lvst)}(t + 1)` is calculated recursively as :math:`\hat{D}_v^{(lvst)}(t + 1) = \hat{D}_v^{(lvst)}(t)\left[1 + \lambda \Delta M(t)\right]`.

   * Let *g* be the index (:math:`1 \leq g \leq m`) of grassland in the land use vector *x*. Then the unadjusted area of grassland available for each livestock of type *v* to graze on is :math:`\tilde{G}_v(t) = \frac{G_v(0)}{x_g(0)}\tilde{x}_g(t)`.

   * The policy-specified unadjusted production capacity of each livestock type *v* is :math:`\tilde{P}_v^{(lvst)}(t) = \tilde{G}_v(t)\chi(t)`

#. **Adjust grassland area to reflect demand changes and livestock import factor** Under uncertain futures, land use area and demand for livestock may conflict. This step resolves the conflict by reallocating land use to serve demand.

   * The net surplus demand for livestock of type *v* at time *t* is :math:`S_v^{(lvst)}(t) = D_v^{(lvst)}(t) - \tilde{P}_v^{(lvst)}(t)`

   * In the **MODELNAMEHERE** model, some of this surplus demand can be met endogenously (by adjusting the land use transition), while some can be met from net imports. The quantity used to adjust the land-use transition is found as :math:`\alpha S_v^{(lvst)}`, where :math:`0 \leq \alpha \leq 1` is the **Land Use Reallocation Factor**.
      * If :math:`S_v^{(lvst)}(t) < 0`, the area of grassland will be reapportioned back to cropland, where a second adjustment occurs. Excess cropland is

#. **Adjust cropland area to reflect demand changes and crop import factor**
