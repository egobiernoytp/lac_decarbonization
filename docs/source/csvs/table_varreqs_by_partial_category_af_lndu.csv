Input,Land Use Yield Reallocation Factor,"The land use yield reallocation factor :math:`\eta \in [0, 1]` is used to represent land use responsiveness to changes in demands. 
 | 
 | If :math:`\eta = 1`, then **land use will be reallocated**, diverging from the specified transition matrix. If demands exceed carrying capacity to meet all livestock and crop demands, then the transitions into grassland and cropland are increased to meet demands. If the carrying capacity exceeds demand, then transitions to grassland and croplands are reduced (which also increases forested land). 
 | 
 | If :math:`\eta = 0`, then **land use will remain as specified**, and all remaining demands with be met with net imports. If the demand is less then carrying capacity, then there is an increase in net exports; if demand exceeds carrying capacity, there is an increase in net imports.
 | 
 | For :math:`\eta \in (0, 1)`, there is a mix of reallocation and net imports, which scales linearly between extremes.
