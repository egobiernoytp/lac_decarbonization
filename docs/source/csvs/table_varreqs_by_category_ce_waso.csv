Input,DOC,The average degradable organic carbon,``physparam_boc_$CAT-WASTE-SOLID$``,,,,,0,1,1
Input,Elasticity of Domestic Waste Produced to GDP/Capita,"The elasticity of waste per capita to GDP per capita, which is used to estimate increases in waste as population and GDP/capita rise.",``elasticity_waso_to_gdppc_$CAT-WASTE-SOLID$``,,,,,0,1,1
Input,Initial Composition Fraction Domestic Solid Waste,Represents the initial fraction of all domestic solid waste represented by this type. Per capita growth rates in waste generated by category are projected by applying elasticities to changes in gdp/capita.,``frac_waso_composition_dom_$CAT-WASTE-SOLID$``,,,,,0,1,1
Input,K,"Methane Generation Rate :math:`k`, a physical parameter characterizing the mass decay half-life of each type of waste that is landfilled. Note that, for a half life *t*, the factor *k* is found as :math:`k = \ln(2)/t`. Dfault values of *k* are taken from Volume 5, Chapter 3, Table 3.3 of the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.",``physparam_k_$CAT-WASTE-SOLID$``,,,,,0,1,1
