#How to Use this Documentation

This documentation provides a detailed look at data requirements and interactions between models in the Latin American—Integrated Decarbonization Pathways Model (LAC-IDPM).

### Metavariables and Constructing Input Parameters
This document makes use of the \$VARNAME\$ notation to denote metavariables for parameter and model input variable name.

For example, model input variables used to denote agricutlural activity emission factors by crop type and gas in `model_input_variables.csv` may have the following structure:
`$CAT-CROP$_ef_$UNIT-MASS$_$EMISSION-GAS$_$UNIT-AREA$`, where

- `$CAT-CROP$` is the categorical crop type (e.g., pineapple, banana, coffee, etc.);
- `$EMISSION-GAS$` is the greenhouse gas that is being emitted (e.g. CO$_2$, N$_2$O, CH$_4$)
- `$UNIT-MASS$` is the unit of mass for gas emission (e.g., `kg` for kilograms; some sector variables may use `gg` for gigagrams);
- `$UNIT-AREA$` is the area unit (e.g., `ha` is hectares).

As a tangible example, the CO$_2$ emission factor for banana production, which captures crop burning, decomposition, and other factors, would be entered as `banana_ef_kg_CO2_ha` since, in this case, `$CAT-CROP$ = banana`, `$EMISSION-GAS$ = CO2`, `$UNIT-AREA$ = ha`, `$UNIT-MASS$ = kg`. Similarly, the N$_2$O factor, which includes crop liming and fertilization, would be captured as `banana_ef_kg_N2O_ha`.

These are _metavariables_, which characterize and describe the notation for naming model input variables. Each variable is associated with some _schema_. In the following sections, data requirements and the associated naming schema for `model_input_variables.csv` are

### Emission Attributes and Information

Per IPCC AR6 guidance and the emission metrics used to quantify emission targets in the Paris Agreement, we use the 100-year global warming potential for GHGs. See IPCC AR6 WG1 Physical Basis Chapter 7 and Table 7.SM.7 for the source of these values.

| Gas | Name | CO$_2$ equivalent factor | `$EMISSION-GAS$` |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| CH$_4$ | Methane | 27.9 | `CH$_4$` |
| CO$_2$ | Carbon Dioxide | 1 | `CO$_2$` |
| HFC-23 | HFC-23 | 14600 | `hfc23` |
| HFC-32 | HFC-32 | 771 | `hfc32` |
| HFC-125 | HFC-32 | 3740 | `hfc125` |
| HFC-134a | HFC-134a | 1530 | `hfc134a` |
| HFC-143a | HFC-143a | 5810 | `hfc143a` |
| HFC-152 | HFC-152 | 21.5 | `hfc152` |

| N$_2$O | Nitrus Oxide | 273 | `N$_2$O` |
| SF6 | Sulfur Hexflouride | 25200 | `sf6` |

Additional gasses can be added as necessary

In the git, the file `ref/attribute_ghg.csv` stores this relevant information for use by the integrated modeling system.

#### Categories
Agriculture is divided into the following categories (crops), given by `$CAT-AGRICULTURE$`. Each crop is associated with one of these classifciations (see https://www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/economic/faodef/annexe.htm for the source of these classifications—on the git, the table `ingestion/FAOSTAT/ref/attribute_fao_crop.csv` contains the information mapping each crop to this crop type). If a crop type is not present in a country, set the associated area as a fraction of crop area to 0.
