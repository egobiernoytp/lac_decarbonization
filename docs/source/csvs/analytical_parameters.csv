Analytical Parameter,Configuration File Parameter,Default Value,Information,Notes
Days per Year,days_per_year,365.25,The number of days in a year; used to convert daily values to annual.,Any floating number can be specified.
Discount Rate,discount_rate,0.05,The discount rate used for analyzing all costs and benefits. This parameter is required and is passed to NemoMod (NemoMod_DiscountRate) to find for the least cost solution.,
Emissions Mass,emissions_mass,MT,Represents the emissions mass used to report out emissions in co2e. MT = megatons; GT = gigatons,
Energy Units,energy_units,PJ,"Units of energy to report out (based on joules). Available units include kJ, MJ, GJ, TJ, and PJ.",
Global Warming Potential,global_warming_potential,100,More information on Global Warming Potential (GWP) can be found from the `EPA <https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials>`_.,"Default is 100. Acceptable values are 20, 100, and 500. See `IPCC AR6 WG1 Chapter 7 - Table 7.SM.7 <https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter_07_Supplementary_Material.pdf>`_ for the source of GWP conversion values. "
Historical Solid Waste Method,historical_solid_waste_method,back_project,"The first order decary (FOD) model used to estimate emissions from solid waste disposal requires an estimate of waste before time :math:`t = 0`. Two methods are supported: 'back_project' and 'historical'. Historical data are read from tables.",
Volume Units,volume_units,m3,Default units for volumes. Used in reporting quantities useful to costs and benefits in the Wastewater Treatment sector.,
