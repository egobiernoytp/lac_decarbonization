Aerobic Treatment - Advanced,``treated_advanced_aerobic``," | Wastewater that is treated in centralized or decentralized aerobic plants. The :math:`\text{CH}_4` emissions accounted for the process itself. Sludge removal and treatment is then sent to the Solid Waste treatment sector.

 | Includes primary, secondary, and tertiary aerobic biological treatment. Primary only should be treated in the ``primary`` category, while primary+secondary should be treated in the ``secondary_aerobic`` treatment category.",,,"In aerobic treatment facilities, waste is removed as sludge.",0.9,0.8,0.95

Anaerobic Treatment - Advanced,``treated_advanced_anaerobic``," | Wastewater that is treated in anaerobic plants, deep lagoons, and other treatment facilities where biological decomposition creates anaerobic :math:`\text{CH}_4` emissions. Excludes shallow lagoons.
