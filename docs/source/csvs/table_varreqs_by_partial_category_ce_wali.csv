Input,Initial Per Capita Annual Domestic Wastwater Generated,"Represents the estimated quantity, in kg/year, that each person produces in domestic wastewater. This value is modified by the log elasticity of production to gdp/capita. Increasing GDP/Capita is associated with increasing per capita liquid waste generation; see `Jones, Vliet, Qadir, and Bierkens (2021) <https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-237-2021>`_.",``qty_wali_$UNIT-VOLUME$_$CAT-WASTE-LIQUID$_per_capita`` (``$UNIT-VOLUME$ = m3``),,``domestic_rural_ww``|``domestic_urban_ww``,,,,0,1,1
Input,Fraction of Protein in Diet With Red Meat,,``frac_wali_protein_in_diet_with_red_meat``,,none,Used to estimate protein content in domestic wastewater. Protein (see IPCC GHG Guidance) .
